```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First, I will import the data.

```{r raw data}
homicide_data =
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Next, I will clean the data and filter the data to necessary items.

```{r cleaning data}
homicide_data =
  homicide_data |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    victim_last = str_to_title(victim_last),
    victim_first = str_to_title(victim_first),
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Solved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Solved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved")) |>
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, OK"))) |>
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black")
```
